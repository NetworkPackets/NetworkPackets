üîç Field Definitions
```
id	Unique record identifier
ts	UNIX timestamp of the record
time	Human-readable timestamp (Y-m-d H:i:s)
iface	Network interface name (e.g. eth0)
rx	Received packets per second (pps)
tx	Transmitted packets per second (pps)
totRx	Total received packets (cumulative)
totTx	Total transmitted packets (cumulative)
udp_rx	Total UDP packets received
udp_tx	Total UDP packets transmitted

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
```
- The API reads the log file packet_stats_all_interfaces.txt located in the same directory.
- The file must be readable by the web server.
- Limit parameter is capped at 500 for performance.
- Timestamps are UNIX epoch integers.
```

üöÄ Example Usage
